---------------------

* First, make sure that you have installed the ``brainlit`` package [`Documentation <https://brainlit.netlify.app/readme#installation>`_].

* Second, uncompress the data ``brainlit/experiments/ViterBrain/data/example.zip``.

* Then, you can run the tutorial notebooks in the ``notebooks`` folder:
    * ``ViterBrain.ipynb`` - shows a programmatic example of the pipeline, based on zarr inputs.
    * other notebooks can be useful for referemce, they were used in generating results in the paper.

* The files in the ``scripts`` folder also can be useful:
    * ``napari_gui.py`` - shows the GUI prototype.
        * click on colored fragment to select, red arrow will identify orientation.
        * o-key to switch orientation of selected fragment.
        * click on another colored fragment (and hit o-key if necessary to switch orientation).
        * click no the labels layer in the left hand pane, then click somewhere on the image (not on a fragment)
        * t-key to trace between fragments.
        * c-key to clear the selected fragments.
        * q-key to clear all annotations.
        * n-key to change colors (3 total colors).

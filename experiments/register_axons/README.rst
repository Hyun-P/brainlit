Neuron Mapping
--------------

* First, make sure that you have installed the ``brainlit`` package [`Documentation <https://brainlit.netlify.app/readme#installation>`_].

* Second, uncompress the data ``brainlit/experiments/register_axons/data/mapping-files.zip``.

* Then, you can run the notebook that generates figures: ``brainlit/experiments/register_axons/map_neurons.ipynb``

* The files in the ``oother`` are more for scratch work, and are unlikely to be useful to new users.
